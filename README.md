# dotfiles
portable location for my personal dotfiles

setup.sh :
----------
* installs pathogen and plugins specified in vim-plugins.txt
* links .bashrc and .vimrc to this repo (just in case backup your original ones)

dependencies:
-------------
* vim-gtk for merging clipboard with yanked section
